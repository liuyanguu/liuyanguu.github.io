      <description>Drake is a powerful tool for automatic reproducible workflow. I found it a perfect match when used together with RMarkdown. There are great documentations online for Drake thus here I only show a simple example working with RMarkdown.
RMarkdown file could be very slow to generate if lots of calculations are involved. Any small revise makes you rerun everything. When we use drake we can do all the calculations in advance thus the rendering is super fast since we only need to re-do the revised object.</description>

      <description>DataVersion 1: Color both the branches and labelsVersion 2: color only the labels.Version 3: If there is no color, and we do not reorder the branchesThis data visualization example include:
* Hierarchical clustering, dendrogram and heat map based on normalized odds ratios
* The dendrogram was built separately to give color to dendrogramâ€™s branches/labels based on cluster using dendextend
* Heatmap is made by heatmap.</description>
