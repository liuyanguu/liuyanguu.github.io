      <description>Namespace:Files locations:Although SHAPforxgboost is not a complicated package, it took me some time to get the package pass all the cran check.
I started with usethis package https://usethis.r-lib.org/ to initiate the package.
Namespace:It is unnecessary to add Depends in the DESCRIPTION except R (&amp;gt;= 3.3.0). And the Imports part in DESCRIPTION is irrelevant to what you import into NAMESPACE in the code (although they are both import).</description>

      <description>SHAP package in RWhy SHAP valuesLocal ExplanationConsistency in Global Feature ImportanceSHAP plotsSummary plotDependence plotInteraction effectsSHAP force plotReferencesSHAP package in RI built an R package SHAPforxgboost that wraps all the R plotting functions illustrated in this post. It serves for now as the vignette for the package.
Please install from github.
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;liuyanguu/SHAPforxgboost&amp;quot;)Why SHAP valuesSHAP’s main advantages are local explanation and consistency in global model structure.</description>

Using geojsonMap (leaflet) It sounds easy and straight-forward but turned out not as simple as I expected. I will show 50-state (including Alaska and Hawaii) United States thematic map, with map scale, with state abbreviations China thematic map, with map scale, with names of provinces in either</description>

      <description>How to embed ShinyMy Shiny app exampleHow to embed ShinySince Blogdown is for static websites, it cannot run Shiny in rmarkdown directly. According to discussion here and document here.
The only way to do it is using iframe and write outside the chunk:
&amp;lt;iframe src=&#34;https://liuyanguu.shinyapps.io/bcl_app/&#34; width=1000 height=800&#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
There is also a built-in function in knitr to do the same thing and write in the chunk.</description>

      <description>DataShrinkageDART: Dropout - MARTskip_droprate_dropone_dropIt is always a good idea to study the packaged algorithm with a simple example. Inspired by my colleague Kodi’s excellent work showing how xgboost handles missing values, I tried a simple 5x2 dataset to show how shrinkage and DART influence the growth of trees in the model.
Dataset.seed(123)n0 &amp;lt;- 5X &amp;lt;- data.</description>

      <description>BackgroundUsing autoxgboostNew ResultCompared to old ResultTuning over Different BoostersReturn the recommended/chosen parameters(updated on Oct 14)
BackgroundIt has been a while since my last update. I have been working on lots of interesting projects since I joined Mount Sinai in August. We have a great team here and obviously I can learn a lot from everyone around me. Most of my job so far focuses on applying machine learning techniques, mainly extreme gradient boosting and the visualization of results.</description>

      <description>Saturation in ten cities with equal-area ringsR Code for one cityResults for the ring saturationsAverage saturation in each ringMethodologyOriginal CodeThis data visualization example include:
* Import .img file as a raster
* Turn raster into a data.frame of points (coordinates) and values
* Dividing the points into 100 equal-area rings
* Calculate Built-up Area/Urban Extent for each ring
* Turn dataframe into raster</description>

      <description>DataVersion 1: Color both the branches and labelsVersion 2: color only the labels.Version 3: If there is no color, and we do not reorder the branchesThis data visualization example include:
* Hierarchical clustering, dendrogram and heat map based on normalized odds ratios
* The dendrogram was built separately to give color to dendrogram’s branches/labels based on cluster using dendextend
* Heatmap is made by heatmap.</description>

      <description>OverviewAbout the Data1. Extreme Gradient Boosting2. Gradient boosting3. Random Forest4. Lasso5. Best SubsetCompare MSEsOriginal CodeOverviewI recently had the great pleasure to meet with Professor Allan Just and he introduced me to eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). I have extended the earlier work on my old blog by comparing the results across XGBoost, Gradient Boosting (GBM), Random Forest, Lasso, and Best Subset.</description>

      <description>Introducing my new blog written solely in R MarkdownWhen I realized it was so convenient to write blog directly using R Markdown, I searched if there is a specific tool for it. And I found Blogdown, an R package developed by Yihui Xie, who is also the author of R Markdown.
CatalogAs a summary, I would like to create a catalog for the main topics I wrote on google blogger before July 2018.</description>
