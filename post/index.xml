      <description>BackgroundOld ResultUsing autoxgboostNew ResultTuning over Different Boosters(updated on Oct 14)
BackgroundIt has been a while since my last update. I have been working on lots of interesting projects since I joined Mount Sinai in August. We have a great team here and obviously I can learn a lot from everyone around me. Most of my job so far focuses on extreme gradient boosting and visualization of results.</description>

      <description>Saturation in ten cities with equal-area ringsR Code for one cityResults for the ring saturationsAverage saturation in each ringMethodologyOriginal CodeThis data visualization example include:
* Import .img file as a raster
* Turn raster into a data.frame of points (coordinates) and values
* Dividing the points into 100 equal-area rings
* Calculate Built-up Area/Urban Extent for each ring
* Turn dataframe into raster</description>

      <description>DataVersion 1: Color both the branches and labelsVersion 2: color only the labels.Version 3: If there is no color, and we do not reorder the branchesThis data visualization example include:
* Hierarchical clustering, dendrogram and heat map based on normalized odds ratios
* The dendrogram was built separately to give color to dendrogram’s branches/labels based on cluster using dendextend
* Heatmap is made by heatmap.</description>

      <description>OverviewAbout the Data1. Extreme Gradient Boosting2. Gradient boosting3. Random Forest4. Lasso5. Best SubsetCompare MSEsOriginal CodeOverviewI recently had the great pleasure to meet with Professor Allan Just and he introduced me to eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). I have extended the earlier work on my old blog by comparing the results across XGBoost, Gradient Boosting (GBM), Random Forest, Lasso, and Best Subset.</description>

      <description>Introducing my new blog written solely in R MarkdownWhen I realized it is so convenient to write blog directly using R Markdown, I searched if there is a specialized tool for it. And I found Blogdown, an R package developed by Yihui Xie, who is also the author of R Markdown.
CatalogAs a summary, I would like to create a catalog for the main topics I wrote on google blogger before July 2018.</description>
