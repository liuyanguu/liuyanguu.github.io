      <description>Introducing my new blog written solely in R MarkdownWhen I realized it is so convenient to write blog directly using R Markdown, I searched if there is a specialized tool for it. And I found Blogdown, an R package written by Yihui Xie, who is also the author of R Markdown.
CatalogAs a summary, I would like to create a catalog for the main topics I wrote on google blogger before July 2018.</description>

      <description>Saturation in 10 cities with equal-area ringsR Code for one cityResults for the ring saturationsAverage saturation in each ringMethodologyThis data visualization example include:
* Import .img file as a raster
* Turn raster into a dataframe of points (coordinates) and values
* Dividing the points into 100 equal-area rings
* Calculate Built-up Area/Urban Extent for each ring
* Turn dataframe into raster</description>

      <description>DataVersion 1: Color both the branches and labelsVersion 2: color only the labels.Version 3: If there is no color, and we do not reorder the branchesThis data visualization example include:
* Hierarchical clustering, dendrogram and heat map based on normalized odds ratios
* The dendrogram was built separately to give color to dendrogramâ€™s branches/labels based on cluster using dendextend
* Heatmap is made by heatmap.</description>

      <description>OverviewAbout the Data1. Extreme Gradient Boosting2. Gradient boosting3. Random Forest4. Lasso5. Best SubsetCompare MSEsCodeOverviewI recently had the great pleasure to meet with Professor Allan Just and he introduced me to eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). I have extended the earlier work on my old blog by comparing the results across XGBoost, Gradient Boosting (GBM), Random Forest, Lasso, and Best Subset.</description>

      <title>About Blogdown and Hugo XMag Theme</title>

      <description>Yang: This is an original page enclosed by Yihui Xie in the Hugo XMag theme he wrote. I really like it and use it for this blog. This post gives a great introduction to how this blog works.
XMag is the second Hugo theme I have designed. It is based on my first Hugo theme XMin, and similarly, features minimalism but with a magazine style on the homepage inspired by The Signpost on Wikipedia.</description>

      <description>This blog was created from the R package blogdown written by Yihui Xie.
All the posts were written exclusively using R Markdown.
I started my old blog in the beginning of 2018 to keep a better record of my work and share some of my experience from programming to solve problems. It records the technical details behind many of my works. I hope it can help my colleague to track the history of some of our projects.</description>
