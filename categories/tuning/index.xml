      <description>BackgroundOriginal ResultUsing autoxgboostNew ResultBackgroundIt has been a while since my last update. I have been working on lots of interesting projects since I joined Mount Sinai in August. We have a great team here and obviously I can learn a lot from everyone around me. Most of my job so far focuses on extreme gradient boosting and visualization of results. Suggested by Allan, I recently tested autoxgboost, which is so easy to use and runs much faster than the naive grid or random search illustrated in my earlier post on XGBoost.</description>
