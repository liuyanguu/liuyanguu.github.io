      <description>BackgroundOriginal ResultUsing autoxgboostNew ResultBackgroundIt has been a while since my last update. I have been working on lots of interesting projects since I joined Mount Sinai in August. We have a great team here and obviously I can learn a lot from everyone around me. Most of my job so far focuses on extreme gradient boosting and visualization of results. Suggested by Allan, I recently tested autoxgboost, which is so easy to use and runs much faster than the naive grid or random search illustrated in my earlier post on XGBoost.</description>

      <description>OverviewAbout the Data1. Extreme Gradient Boosting2. Gradient boosting3. Random Forest4. Lasso5. Best SubsetCompare MSEsOriginal CodeOverviewI recently had the great pleasure to meet with Professor Allan Just and he introduced me to eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). I have extended the earlier work on my old blog by comparing the results across XGBoost, Gradient Boosting (GBM), Random Forest, Lasso, and Best Subset.</description>
